# Matrix Calculator
- This project was built during my 3rd Semester.
- It is a basic matrix calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.
- I used C++ vectors to build this project.

## Matrix Calculator Project

This project is a fundamental exercise in applying mathematical operations using programming, specifically focusing on matrices. The matrix calculator is designed to handle basic operations, making it a useful tool for learning and understanding matrix manipulation in computer science.

### Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for implementing the matrix operations, chosen for its performance and efficiency.
- **C++ Vectors**: Utilized for dynamic array management, allowing flexible and efficient storage and manipulation of matrix data.

### Key Features

- **Matrix Addition**: Allows the addition of two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Subtraction**: Enables the subtraction of one matrix from another.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Supports the multiplication of two matrices, provided the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second.
- **Matrix Transpose**: Computes the transpose of a given matrix, swapping rows and columns.
